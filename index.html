              are my favourite as they offer comfort and entertainment. I am

              I got into card magic a year ago and have been doing it since. I
              love the hilarious reactions of people when I figure out their
              card without looking at it. This has been a very important part of
              my life because of the enjoyment it offers. Most of the tricks are
              really simple like this one.

              We go to Victoria Park every year and it is one of my favourite
              times. I get to play games with friends and family and eat
              delicious food. Victoria Park is the best location for our picnic
              since it is big and allows us to be in private. Click
